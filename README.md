## Installation

Each backend requires additional dependencies that must be explicitly chosen using the [PEP508 Extras](https://peps.python.org/pep-0508/#extras) that cover it. The following command will install `wsgi-auth-middleware` with all supported backends.

```console
pip install wsgi-auth-middleware[gssapi,pam]
```

## Usage

This middleware package provides the `HttpAuthWsgiMiddleware` class and various callables that implement authentication primitives. The result of wrapping a WSGI app with `HttpAuthWsgiMiddleware` will be a new WSGI app that performs HTTP authentication and, upon success, places the authenticated username string in `environ["REMOTE_USER"]`.

`wsgi-auth-middleware` is designed to be flexible. You can mix and match HTTP authentication schemes (frontends) with any system authentication backends that support their interfaces. Typical usage looks like this:

```python
from wsgi_auth_middleware import HttpAuthWsgiMiddleware
from wsgi_auth_middleware.frontends import BasicFrontend, NegotiateFrontend
from wsgi_auth_middleware.backends import PamBackend, GssapiBackend

pam_backend = PamBackend(service='my_pam_service')
basic_frontend = BasicFrontend(auth_backends=[pam_backend], realm='my realm')

gssapi_backend = GssapiBackend(fqdn='example.org')
negotiate_frontend = NegotiateFrontend(auth_backends=[gssapi_backend])

# Authentication will be tried in the sequential order given by `auth_frontends`.
authenticated_app = HttpAuthWsgiMiddleware(
    app=my_wsgi_app,
    auth_frontends=[negotiate_frontend, basic_frontend]
)
```
